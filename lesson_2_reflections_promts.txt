What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need
to do it?

When using git init if causes a .git file to be added to the file
that was intialized this will allow git to track changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is an area of choosing which files will be added to the next commit.
It allows you to separate out changes in more than one file into different 
commits.  Thus easier to find bugs.
