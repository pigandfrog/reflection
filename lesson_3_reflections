When would you want to create a remote repository instead of keeping all your files locally?

When you want to be able to use the info from different computers or to be able to collaborate with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes the thing that you are working on, you may want to be different than the
repository that is found on GitHub.
