How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   

it allowed used to see the changes, or the differences that were found between 
two different files



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?



It would allow you to make changes and if they caused a lot of problems you 
could go back to an older version of the file.
You can search the differences between two different files.





What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    



The pros of letting the system do it automatically is that you sometimes forget to make a commit until it 
is too late.
the cons of automatically doing it is that you loose ability to do custimization.
That is at logical times so that the commits will make sense.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    



git should allow it because often, a program is comprised of several different files.
Documents such as the ones that are used with google documents treat each file separately becuase they generally are.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

Git log will show you all the previous commits that you have done from the one
that you are currently at.
Git diff will allow you to see additions and deletions between two different 
commits.--Thus allowing you to find the bugs in the program.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Fill in your answer here

You would be more confident becuase you would be able to go back and change
 to a previous state.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to try to use it for learning how to do commits using projects 
that I have coded.
